<p>I got into Software Engineering for a career change and because I am addicted to new technology and I enjoy problem solving. This field will give me the freedom to spend more time with my family and travel, especially if I have the ability to work remotely.  I have been laid off at least 7 times within 14 years, I'm looking for a career that will give me stability and allow me to learn and grow.  I am ready to live life like I imagined not like what I've been living.</p>
